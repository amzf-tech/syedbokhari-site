        This page outlines my practice focus in behaviour support for NDIS participants and provider teams.
        <strong> My application is under assessment by the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission (Alternate Pathway).</strong>
        During this period, service delivery may occur under professional supervision and through an appropriately
        registered organisation, in line with applicable NDIS requirements.

          Application currently under assessment (Alternate Pathway). Where services are delivered, they are delivered
          under supervision and through an appropriately registered organisation in accordance with applicable NDIS
          requirements and standards. Independent delivery under my own NDIS registration will commence following approval.

      <h2 class="h2">How support is provided</h2>
      <p class="p">
        Behaviour support is delivered in collaboration with the supervising practitioner and the registered organisation.
        This includes structured supervision, review of assessment information, and oversight of behaviour support planning
        and implementation support. Service delivery arrangements are confirmed with the contracting provider and aligned
        with applicable NDIS requirements.

      <h2 class="h2">Practice approach</h2>
      <p class="p">
        My practice approach is person-centred, respectful, and grounded in positive behaviour support principles.
        I work collaboratively with participants, families, and support teams to understand behaviour within its context
        and to support quality-of-life outcomes, capacity building, and safe, consistent supports.
