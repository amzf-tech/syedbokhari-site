            <h2>Before the Meeting</h2>
            <p>A productive first meeting sets the tone for a successful partnership. As a <strong>Registered Practitioner</strong>, my goal is to ensure this process is transparent, respectful, and evidence-based from day one.</p>

            <h3>Gather Relevant Information</h3>
            <p>Having these documents ready helps us hit the ground running:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Current NDIS plan and specific goals</li>
              <li>Past Behaviour Support Plans (BSPs) or assessments</li>
              <li>Incident reports or "ABC" data logs from the last 3 months</li>
              <li>Relevant medical, OT, or Speech Pathology reports</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Who Should Attend?</h2>
            <p>Behaviour support is most effective when it is collaborative. We often refer to this as the "Circle of Support."</p>
            
            

            <p>While the <strong>Participant</strong> should be at the heart of the meeting, it is often helpful to have a primary family member and a representative from the daily support team present to provide diverse perspectives.</p>

            <h3>Questions for Me</h3>
            <p>I encourage you to interview me as much as I interview you. You might ask:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>What is your experience with similar support needs?</li>
              <li>How do you involve the participant in the decision-making process?</li>
              <li>How do you approach the reduction of restrictive practices?</li>
              <li>What does your communication look like with our existing team?</li>
            </ul>
