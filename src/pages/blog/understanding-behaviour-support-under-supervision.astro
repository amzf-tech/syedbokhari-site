            <h2>The Gold Standard of Practice</h2>
            <p>In the disability sector, "Under Supervision" isn't a sign of a lack of skill—it is a sign of a <strong>commitment to clinical excellence</strong>. It means every strategy, assessment, and Behaviour Support Plan (BSP) is vetted by a Senior Practitioner to ensure it meets the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission's standards.</p>

            

            <h2>How This Benefits You</h2>
            <h3>1. Dual Expertise</h3>
            <p>When you work with me, you aren't just getting my insights. You are getting the combined experience of myself and my Clinical Supervisor. This "four-eyes" principle ensures that complex cases are viewed from multiple professional angles, reducing bias and improving outcomes.</p>

            <h3>2. Compliance & Safety</h3>
            <p>The NDIS Capability Framework is rigorous. Working under supervision ensures that all documentation regarding <strong>Restrictive Practices</strong> is legally compliant, reducing the administrative burden on families and providers while keeping participants safe.</p>

            <h3>3. Modern, Evidence-Based Methods</h3>
            <p>Practitioners under supervision are often the most up-to-date with the latest academic research and Positive Behaviour Support (PBS) methodologies. We combine this fresh research with the "tried and tested" wisdom of veteran supervisors.</p>

            <h2>FAQs About Supervision</h2>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Does it cost more?</strong> No. The NDIS hourly rate for behaviour support remains the same regardless of the practitioner's level. You are essentially getting two professionals for the price of one.</li>
              <li><strong>Will I ever meet the supervisor?</strong> Usually, the supervisor works behind the scenes, but they are always available to review data and provide guidance on complex situations.</li>
              <li><strong>Is it private?</strong> Absolutely. Supervision is a confidential professional process designed solely to improve the quality of care.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
            <p>Transparency is the foundation of my practice. If you have questions about my supervision arrangements or would like to know more about the Senior Practitioners I consult with, I am always happy to discuss this during our initial meeting.</p>
