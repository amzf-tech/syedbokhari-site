            <h2>Understanding the Goal of Support</h2>
            <p>As a <strong>Registered NDIS Behaviour Support Practitioner</strong>, I often tell families that behaviour support isn't just about "stopping" a behaviour—it's about increasing the person's quality of life so that the behaviour is no longer needed.</p>

            

            <h2>1. Difficulty Achieving NDIS Goals</h2>
            <p>If behaviours of concern are acting as a "gatekeeper" to the community, it's time for professional intervention. We look at:</p>
            <ul>
              <li><strong>Community Access:</strong> Is the participant being asked to leave venues or missing out on outings?</li>
              <li><strong>Skill Building:</strong> Are behaviours interrupting the time spent learning new daily living skills?</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>2. Use of Restrictive Practices</h2>
            <p>If you find yourself using physical restraint, locking cupboards, or using "PRN" (as-needed) medication frequently, the NDIS requires a regulated <strong>Behaviour Support Plan</strong>. This ensures these practices are monitored and, eventually, faded out through safer alternatives.</p>

            <h2>3. Support Team Burnout</h2>
            <p>High staff turnover is a major red flag. If support workers feel unsafe or confused about how to respond, the resulting inconsistency often makes the participant's behaviour more intense. A unified <strong>PBS plan</strong> brings the whole team onto the same page.</p>

            <h2>4. Social and Emotional Withdrawal</h2>
            <p>Sometimes the sign isn't an "outward" behaviour like hitting or shouting, but an "inward" one—like refusal to leave a room or social withdrawal. Behaviour support helps uncover the sensory or emotional triggers behind this "shutting down."</p>

            <h2>5. Major Life Transitions</h2>
            <p>The NDIS journey is full of changes. Whether it's moving from school to work or moving into <strong>SDA/SIL accommodation</strong>, these transitions are high-stress periods where proactive support can prevent a crisis before it starts.</p>
