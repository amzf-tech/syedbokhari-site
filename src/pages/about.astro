          I am a <strong>Core-level Behaviour Support Practitioner (under supervision)</strong> working with
          NDIS participants, families, and provider teams to support the development and implementation
          of Positive Behaviour Support strategies.
          <strong> My application to the NDIS Quality and Safeguards Commission has been submitted.</strong>

          I currently work as a <strong>Senior Complex Support Needs Planner</strong> with the National Disability

          risks, and collaboration with participants, families, guardians, and providers to develop
          person-centred supports consistent with NDIS legislation and policy.
        </p>

        <p class="p">
          Through this work, I have developed strong experience in safeguarding considerations,
          least-restrictive practice, multidisciplinary collaboration, and high-quality professional documentation.
          I work closely with specialist providers, including Behaviour Support Practitioners, and contribute to
          risk-informed and ethically grounded decision-making.
